# Amazon-Price-Tracker
Checking regularly if the price of a particular product has gone down can be a bit tiring. 
so I tried to build an automated price tracker in Python.

Used Selenium library to retrieve the prices of a particular searched product and then compare it with the price that 
you expect the item to fall below.
